                    <p>
                        My name is Stephanie Collins and I am currently a Masters of Information candidate at the University of Toronto. I am also enrolled 
                        in the University of Toronto's Coding Boot Camp. My main passion is cybersecurity - both the technical aspects as well as related
                        policies. I am hoping to begin a career as a programmer in Toronto where I live with my rabbit (pictured) and too many dogs.
                        If you are an interested recruiter, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn (link provided below).
                    </p>

                    <p>This website and the projects it links to serve are examples of my work from the University of Toronto's Coding Boot Camp, and serve
                        as my portfolio.
